# Fruit classification with machine learning
In this project, we use machine learning methods with Python's scikit-learn library to develop AI models capable of telling apart images of apples from oranges.

We use five different models:
<ol>
  <li>Logistic regression;</li>
  <li>Decision trees;</li>
  <li>Random forests;</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machines (SVMs);</li>
  <li>k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN).</li>
</ol>

We find that four of the models perform roughly equally well, and are able to classify around 75% of unseen images correctly (with decision trees performing a little worse).

A write-up of the project, including a description of the data, its source, all the methods used and the results, is available as a .ipynb notebook, and all the raw code is also available as a .py file.
